        <h3 class="heading">Carolina Athletics</h3>
        <p class="text">
            Growing up a Carolina fan, my dream school to watch sports at (and attend) has been Carolina for awhile. I watched my first Carolina 
            basketball game in-person my 6th grade year, and I haven't looked back since! I still remember exactly where I was when I watched our 
            heartbreaking defeat to Villanova in the NCAA championship in 2016, shortly after Marcus Paige hit the best shot that will never be remembered. 
            I remember watching my Tarheels cling onto "Redemption" the following year, and bringing home the natty my senior year of high school. While in college, 
            I have devoted countless hours to Carolina Athletics. I proudly watched as our field hockey team dominated other teams en route to back-to-back undefeated 
            seasons and championships. At the same time, I mourned with our women's soccer team as they fell in back-to-back seasons in the championship game. However, 
            perhaps my favorite sports memory occurred around 10 PM on Sept. 9, 2019. I watched in the front row of Kenan Stadium as my beloved Tarheels battled with Miami as the game 
            approached an end. After converting a 4th-and-17, freshman phenom Sam Howell threw a touchdown pass to Dazz Newsome to take the lead. Did I mention I had front 
            row seats and witnessed this miraculous play occur right in front of me?

        <h3 class="heading">House Debates</h3>
        <p class="text">
            Over the last year-plus, I have had the opportunity to live with 7 other guys in a house we have dubbed "The Tub". While you can imagine how messy 
            a house run by 8 college-aged boys may look, perhaps more interesting is some of the conversations we have. Most infamous in the Tub is the debate over 
            whether biscuits are cake or bread. Fast forward several hours of playful screaming and convoluted hand motions describing our thoughts and the majority of 
            our house has decided that biscuits are bread (sorry Don). Another more recent argument that has recently picked up steam is the discussion of what constitutes 
            a condiment. Is a condiment simply some sort of traditional idea of a condiment that is essentially defined by "sauces" that one might add to a burger or hotdog? 
            Or is a condiment anything that adds supplemental value (such as peanut butter on apples)? The world may never know.
        </p>
        <h3 class="heading">Christianity</h3>
        <p class="text">
            As I mentioned on my home page, the most important thing about me is my identity in Christ. As a Christian, I believe that I am a child of God and that nothing 
            in this world can strip that identity from me. When I think about Christianity, I don't see a religion that is predicated on rules or laws. In fact, a fundamental 
            belief of Christianity is that our value is not dependent on our morality, but on our humanity. You see, all humans are created in God's image and our purpose is to 
            bear that image well. However, both you and I could honestly assess ourselves and determine that, at some point, we failed to bear that image, and in doing so, failed 
            to fulfill our purpose. But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together 
            with Christ-by grace you have been saved (Ephesians 2:4-5). Every one of us deserves death because of our sin (disobedience to God), but God graciously extended His hand and offers to save us. 
            One might ask, "How is this possible? How can God simply forget the bad things we have done?".
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            The response to this question is precisely where Jesus becomes the hero. Two thousand years ago, Jesus, who is fully God, was born in Bethlehem and dwelt among His fellow Jews. 
            After living a perfect life (because how else could God live?) and demonstrating His power on Earth, Jesus demonstrated His love for us in this, that while we were still sinners, 
            Christ died for us! Through His death, he suffered the punishment for our sins that we deserved! Jesus didn't deserve to be punished, but willingly suffered for our sake that we 
            might be made righteous. And this isn't just an ordinary man that claimed to be God and died, but rather proved that He was God through His resurrection three days later. I like 
            to call God's offer for you "The Jesus Exchange". You see, Jesus swapped His righteousness for our sin and bore the punishment. In doing so, He offers us the reward of righteousness: 
            eternal life! However, the story doesn't end there. After Jesus raised from the dead, He commanded His disciples to tell the world about what they had witnessed. As a follower of Jesus, 
            my aim is to finish the task that the Lord has given me: to testify to the gospel of the grace of God. This is the gospel: that Jesus took our place on the cross and offers us eternal life!
