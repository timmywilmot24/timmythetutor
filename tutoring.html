        <h2 class="heading">Tutoring Overview</h2>
        <p class="text">
            For the fall of 2020, I am offering a math tutoring service to help students achieve high grades and understand material more clearly. For $20/hour, 
            we can meet (virtually over Zoom or in-person at UNC-Chapel Hill) and talk about your class and figure out how to position you to succeed in your class! 
            With over 4 years of tutoring experience, both privately and through the UNC Math Help Center, I offer a broad range of experience to help you. I am qualified 
            to tutor in the following classes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="text bullet">MATH 110, 129, 231, 232, 233, 381, and 547</li>
            <li class="text bullet">STOR 155, 215, 305, 415, 435, 455, and 565</li>
            <li class="text bullet">COMP 110, 116, 401, 410, 411, 426, 455, and 550</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text">
            Sporting a  3.93 GPA in these classes, I have demonstrated a proficiency to understand concepts in each of these courses. Not only am I academically proficient, 
            however, but I also have tangible stories of students improving their grades over the course of a semester.
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading">A Tutoring Story</h2>
        <p class="text">
            In my first official experience of tutoring, I was a senior in high school tutoring a college freshman in Pre-Calculus. His mother approached 
            me and asked if I could tutor her son by reteaching concepts to him. Currently bordering a failing grade, his mother was concerned that he may 
            have to retake the class, but asked if I could try to help him simply get a D. Over the course of the semester, I went over to his house once a 
            week for about 3 hours. Through the semester, not only did we get to develop a friendship, but he also saw his grade improve to a B!
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading">Why Me?</h2>
        <p class="text">
            As a senior at UNC-Chapel Hill, I have been in your shoes. I have taken difficult classes, stayed up doing homework into the wee hours of 
            the night, and studied vigorously to pass exams. I know what it's like to be a student. However, in addition to being a student, I have also
            been able to work as a tutor dating back to high school. I have worked with all grade levels, ranging from sixth grade to seniors in college,
            and in many different circumstances. I have walked alongside struggling students temporarily to study well for an exam, as well as tutored 
            long-term over the course of a semester. As a tutor, I intend to be flexible enough to simultaneoursly address both groups of people and fully 
            plan on seeing you acheive your dream grade in difficult classes.
