            <p class="text home"> My name is Timmy Wilmot and I am currently a senior at UNC-Chapel Hill.
                I am studying for a double B.S. in Statistics and Computer Science.
                Just like a typical student at Carolina, I love Carolina Athletics and can truly
                claim that every day is a great day to be a Tarheel. Outside of Carolina
                Athletics, I am also an incredibly avid sports fan, particularly in baseball, football,
                 and basketball. I frequently enjoy Cookout runs, playing video games such as Smash
                 and Fortnite, and debating intense topics with my housemates (Yes Don, biscuits are indeed bread).
                 However, perhaps most importantly, I am a follower of Jesus that attends the Summit Church 
                 on the weekends and is involved with Summit College at UNC-Chapel Hill. Now that you have 
                 gotten to know me a little bit, I look forward to getting to know you! Feel free to venture to 
                 any of the other pages and I'd love to meet you sometime.
